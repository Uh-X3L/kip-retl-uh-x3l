Azure AI Agents Module - Specialized agents for different workflows

This module provides a comprehensive agent system with intelligent reuse capabilities:

- BaseAgent: Foundation class with Azure agent reuse logic
- WebResearchAnalyst: Specialized for research and competitive analysis  
- ProjectPlanner: Specialized for project planning and management
- DevOpsAgent: Specialized for CI/CD, infrastructure, and deployment
- AgentRegistry: Centralized agent management and reuse system
- AgentManager: High-level interface for all agent operations

Usage:
```python
from helpers.agents import AgentManager

# Initialize with Azure AI Projects client
with AgentManager(project_client) as manager:
    # Get specialized agents
    research_agent = manager.get_research_agent()
    planner_agent = manager.get_planner_agent()
    devops_agent = manager.get_devops_agent()
    
    # Use high-level workflows
    results = manager.research_and_plan_project(
        project_description="Build a web application",
        research_depth="comprehensive"
    )
    
    # Get DevOps solutions
    devops_solution = manager.create_devops_solution(
        project_type="python_web_app"
    )
```

Key Features:
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Intelligent agent reuse to avoid redundant creation
- üìä Comprehensive usage tracking and analytics  
- üßπ Automatic cleanup of inactive agents
- üéØ Specialized agents for different domains
- üîÑ Multi-agent workflows for complex tasks
- üìà Performance optimization and monitoring
